=head1 NAME

LWP::UserAgent::CHICaching - LWP::UserAgent with caching based on CHI

=head1 SYNOPSIS

The usual way of using L<LWP::UserAgent>, really, just pass a C<cache>
parameter with a L<CHI> object to the constructor:

  my $cache = CHI->new( driver => 'Memory', global => 1 );
  my $ua = LWP::UserAgent::CHICaching->new(cache => $cache);
  my $res1 = $ua->get("http://localhost:3000/?query=DAHUT");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is YA caching user agent. When the client makes a request to the
server, sometimes the response should be cached, so that no actual
request has to be sent at all, or possibly just a request to validate
the cache. HTTP 1.1 defines how to do this. This module makes it
possible to use the very flexible L<CHI> module to manage such a
cache.

But why? Mainly because I wanted to use L<CHI> facilities, and partly
because I wanted to focus on HTTP 1.1 features.

=head2 Attributes and Methods

=over

=item C<< cache >>

Used to set the C<CHI> object to be used as cache in the constructor.

=item C<< key >>, C<< clear_key >>

The key to use for a response. Defaults to the canonical URI of the
request. May make sense to set differently in the future, but should
probably be left alone for now.

=item C<< request_uri >>

The Request-URI of the request. When set, it will clear the C<key>,
but should probably be left to be used internally for now.

=item C<< request >>

Overriding L<LWP::UserAgent>'s request method.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

Will only cache C<GET> requests and only looks at the C<Cache-Control:
max-age> header. Does not make any attempts to see if the response is
invalid.

=head1 TODO

This is a very early release, meant just for the author's immediate
needs. These are the things that I'd like to do:

=over

=item * Enable smarter generation of keys, so that semantically
identical content can be cached efficiently even though they may have
different URIs.

=item * Support all of L<RFC7234|http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234>
and <RFC7232|http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232>
